# insights and analysis

# The scatter plot from 1960 shows severe differences between the regions in life expectancy at birth as well as
# in fertility rate. However, it visualizes a clear trend which says: the higher the fertility rate, the lower the
# life expectancy at birth. The region with the highest life expectancy and the lowest fertility rate in 1960 is
# Europe, which is mainly caused by the high health standards that Europe already had back then. One outlier is 
# noticeable from the Europe region and that is the country of Turkey which is the only country of the region that has
# a life expectancy of less than 60 (45.38 years). The reason for that is that Turkey mainly belongs to Asia and if
# you would change the region to Asia it would not be an outlier, in fact it would fit perfectly in the average of 
# Asia.The countries of America are spread all over the scatter plot. There are countries like Canada and the US 
# that are within the values of the European countries but there are also many countries that have a life expectancy
# of less than 50 and a fertility rate above 6. By taking a second look at the values of the Americas, it becomes 
# obvious that the countries of South America are mainly the ones that can be found in the lower right half of the
# scatter plot. This is due to the bad development that most of the countries had 64 years ago.
# On the other hand, Africa has on average the lowest life expectancy but the highest fertility rate. The lowest 
# life expectancy belongs to Mali, a country that had a really bad time during the 50s and 60s.
# There are two more noticeable outliers from the Africa region. One has the highest fertility rate out of all 
# countries and the other one has the lowest fertility rate by far out of all African countries. The highest 
# fertility rate belongs to the country of Rwanda with an average of 8.19 and the lowest one of Africa is Gabon 
# with an average of 4.38. The regions of Oceania and the Middle East for the most part represent the average of 
# all regions. 
# 
# The scatter plot from 2020 shows lower differences in both, the life expectancy at birth as well as in the fertility
# rate. The difference between the highest and lowest life expectancy is now about 35 years, and the difference 
# between the highest and lowest fertility rate is only from below two to 7 instead of more than 8 in 1960. It is 
# noticeable that by 2020 many Asian countries have increased their life expectancy and are now together with Europe 
# in the top tier. Actually, on average every country increased their life expectancy and lowered their fertility rate.
# The highest life expectancy in 1960 was from Norway in Europe, in 2020 it now is Hong Kong in Asia. Now two of 
# the top three life expectancies are from Asia. The biggest development was made by the Americas region who could
# not only increase their life expectancy by far but also heavily lowered their average fertility rates by almost
# half.
# 
# It is remarkable that in 1960 there were 30 countries with a life expectancy of less than 40, whereas in 2020 there
# were only two countries with a lower life expectancy than 50! In 1960 more than 20 countries had a fertility rate
# of more than 7, in 2020 it was only 1. The highest life expectancy was around 74 (in 1960) and increased to 30 
# countries having a higher life expectancy at birth than 80 years. The biggest evolutions were made in terms of
# the fertility rate. In 1960 only three countries had a fertility rate lower than 2, in 2020 there were 70 countries.
# Most of these changes can be explained by an economic boom and major developments in the healthcare.
