<h4> Text Adventure Game (Python) </h4>
<br>
<p> Welcome to the Python Text Adventure Game - Surviving in Jurassic Park <br>
The game is based on the movie Jurassic Park (Spielberg, S. (1993). Jurassic Park. Universal Pictures.) and its
story is slightly changed for the purpose of this game. The background story for the game is the following:

You are a visitor of the park and admiring the fascinating landscapes of the island as well as the breathtaking
creatures in form of dinosaurs. It is a warm and sunny day, a light wind is blowing and you enjoy the adventure
– when all of a sudden you can hear loud noises. You try to identify what those noises are and where they come
from. In that exact moment you realize that these are the sirens and alarm systems of the park… </p>

<h4> Regression Modeling (Python) </h4>
<br>
<p> The bike sharing industry has grown tremendously in recent years, with an estimated global value of $2.8 billion in 2023. There are several reasons for this development, starting with a growing awareness for sustainability, to physical interest and convenience. As a result of the market's growth, the Cook County Planning and Development Department, which is responsible for the Chicago metropolitan area in the US, wants to improve its understanding of the bike rental dynamics. They seek to benefit from developing a predictive model to forecast future bike rentals and aim to identify main factors behind the rental numbers.
This analysis will first explore and prepare the data provided before creating new features for the model. Following that, six several model types will be developed trying to achieve the best model. </p>

<h4> Classification Modeling (Python) </h4>
<br>
<p> This project provides a comprehensive analysis of social media engagement in Thailand, focusing on how different content types—photos, videos, and texts—resonate with users. Utilizing data-driven techniques like Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and k-means clustering, the study measures user interactions and defines engagement levels and emotional responses. The findings indicate that photos generate the most 'Likes' due to their visual appeal, while videos attract 'Love' and 'Wow' reactions, reflecting their ability to capture interest. Text posts, though less emotionally engaging, effectively serve their niche. Additionally, classification modeling helped identify characteristics of content that drive user engagement and emotional reactions, enhancing predictive accuracy to optimize targeting and resource allocation. This analysis not only assists businesses in tailoring content to audience preferences in Thailand but also offers a strategic roadmap applicable to wider markets. </p>
